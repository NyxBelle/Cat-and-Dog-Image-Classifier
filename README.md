# 🐱🐶 Cat and Dog Image Classifier

A beginner-friendly image classification project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. This notebook is part of the [freeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/) course.

## 📘 About the Project

This project trains a CNN to distinguish between cat and dog images using image augmentation, convolutional layers, and ReLU/MaxPooling strategies. It includes evaluation via loss/accuracy plots and prediction on unseen images.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colaboratory

## 🧪 Features

- Data preparation with `ImageDataGenerator`
- Custom CNN with Conv2D and MaxPooling layers
- Model evaluation with accuracy/loss visualization
- Prediction on custom image uploads

## 📈 Results

The model shows steady improvement in training and validation accuracy. Loss curves demonstrate a good learning rate and convergence pattern.
